o readsst gains a "readall" argument, if TRUE then lon180 and xylim arguments are ignored

o icefiles now returns dates and file names with options for product, hemisphere, and time.resolution

o readcurr now returns data in "longitude/latitude" on the sphere, rather than Mercator as the data source has been changed by the provider

o support for monthly SST has been temporarily removed (o applied missing landmask for monthly SST)

o new function rapid_responsefiles uses new repository structure, along with modifications to readrapid_response 
function

o readice and icefiles now use the new repository structure, with the old versions now internal only called .icefiles1 and .readice1

o sstfiles and readsst now use the new repository structure, old versions now internal-only, called .sstfiles1 and .readsst1

o currentsfiles and readcurr now use the new repository structure, old versions now internal-only, called .currentsfiles1 and .readcurr1

o sshfiles and readssh now use the new repository structure, old versions now internal-only, called .sshfiles1 and .readssh1


   CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.1-2

o pass the dots argument to brick for most read functions

o internalized usage of raster's rotate, to catch breaking change

o new model for env vars for default.datadir

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.1-1

 from IFREMER
