  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.1-1

ACKNOWLEDEGEMENTS

o Thanks to Neal Young for pointing out incorrect PROJ.4 string for ice data. 

NEW FEATURES

o extract now works for readtopo, assuming lon/lat input

o tidy internal handling of file indexes, and file catalog functions

o new function readrapid_response to read MODIS Antarctica images

BUG FIXES

o fixed incorrect PROJ.4 string for NSIDC ice data

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.1-0

NEW FEATURES

o added function readfastice to read the fast ice model data

o readcurr gains the arguments uonly and vonly, for single components
of the original vectors so that these can be returned as time series

BUG FIXES

o extract had some serious problems with the time matching of input
points to raster layers

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-10

NEW FEATURES 

o changes to extract(readfunction,) methods to interpolate in time and
space and aggregate spatially, especially for use in Shiny apps

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

o raadtools now depends on raster 2.2-5 or later

BUG FIXES

o sensible management of dateline for readfronts

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-9

o fixed bug in readfronts

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-8

o new function readfronts to return layer/s from the Sokolov/Rintoul fronts

o readchla gains a product argument, to add "oceancolor" for the
original global MODIS and SeaWIFs algorithm

o added function readmld

o sst.pal and chl.pal gain an alpha argument

o added SSRUs CCAMLR polygons to adminmap suite

o aligned wind data to meridian bounds accurately

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-7

 o various bug fixes

NEW FEATURES

 o added adminmap function to load management region polygons

 o added readprod function for Arrigo production estimates

 o added monthly time resolution for readsst

 o added extract method for functions and xyt matrix or data.frame

 o removed hardcoded default date from all read* functions, the
 first/default date is now derived from the file set

 o added new functions readssh and sshfiles for AVISO absolute and
 relative sea surface height

 o added support for SSMI 12.5km southern ocean sea ice concentration
 from IFREMER

 o added readwind function

 o added hidden function to update file cache

 o added data set aurora

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

 o expanded vignette on general use

 o new Rmd vignette on installing and building the package
 
 o extractxyt has been deprecated and will be removed in a future
 version, please use extract instead

BUG FIXES

 o fixes to file caching

 o extractxyt was requiring matching IDs unpleasantly

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-5

NEW FEATURES

 o functions chl.pal and sst.pal to provide the MODIS-generation
 colour palettes

 o new function readchla and chlafiles to manage and read Johnson
 Southern Ocean chlorophyll-a

 o new function coastmap to load common vector map layers

 o new function frontsmap to load vector fronts

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-4

OVERVIEW

 Tidy up for file/date handling code, better organization of these
 tasks for read functions.  

NEW FEATURES

 o new function extractxyt to extract values from spatio-temporal grids

 o read functions are faster and can accept an 'xylim' object to crop
 to a spatial region

 o a draft vignette has been added

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

 o readice, readcurr, readsst have been improved for faster reading,
  100s of layers is now feasible but still memory-bound.

 o experimental graticule was removed

  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-3

OVERVIEW

 New functions for graticule plotting and extracting time series values. 

NEW FEATURES

  o new vignette "raadtools" 

  o new function extractxyt to extract values by longitude,latitude,time

  o new function graticule to return graticule lines from Spatial/raster objects

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

BUG FIXES


  CHANGES IN raadtools VERSION 0.0-2

OVERVIEW

NEW FEATURES

  o functions to return file paths of topographic data

  o functions to read daily SST data

  o functions to read ocean current data

  o readice now returns data for single or multiple dates that are not
  duplicates and are in temporal order
