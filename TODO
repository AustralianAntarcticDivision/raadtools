- unimplement progress counter
- rewrite sstfiles to return relative filename, needs cache fixing
- allow filename for resulting brick

- coastmap/adminmap
- fronts, more sources, temporal
- GEM
- return a RasterLayer rather than a brick when possible

- flesh out vignette to read many data types and different products
  within types, and do general extract processing for points,
  points/times, polygons, etc.



DONE- implement up-front crop for read, especially for multi-layers
