This document aims to give a broad overview of the primary remote sensing sources, their types and era. This is to form the basis of
an "advisable choices" guide, a first-pass way to choose what products are "recommended". 

# Summary of the types of data available for habitat modelling over the satellite era

The primary synoptic and easily-accessible remote sensing era data are based on sensors using passive microwave, radiometry, radar altimetry and optical wavelengths. 

Assessment variables  were chosen based on their accessibility, coverage and relevance to physical and biological change. Sea surface temperature (SST) and sea-ice seasonality are indicative of broad physical trends in ocean and atmospheric properties. Both are readily available with long-time series and good spatial coverage. Ocean topography characterizes the mechanical physical motion of the water bodies at the surface and so is relevant to transport processes in both horizonatal and vertical dimensions. Chlorophyll-a has a shorter time series and patchy spatial coverage but is the most relevant first-choice for synoptic patterns at ocean basin scales.

## Sea ice

The sea ice concentration data used was the NSIDC SMMR-SSM/I Nasateam sea ice concentration, passive-microwave estimates at 25km spatial resolution, available every two days from 1-Oct-1978 to 1987 and then daily to present Cavalieri et al. (1996).

## Sea surface temperature (SST)

The sea surface temperature data used was the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Tempature. "The NOAA 1/4Â° daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (or daily OISST) is an analysis constructed by combining observations from different platforms (satellites, ships, buoys) on a regular global grid. A spatially complete SST map is produced by interpolating to fill in gaps."

## Ocean topography

CMEMS global gridded SSH reprocessed (1993-ongoing)

"For the Global Ocean - Multimission altimeter satellite gridded sea surface heights and derived variables computed with respect to a twenty-year mean. Previously distributed by Aviso+, no change in the scientific content. All the missions are homogenized with respect to a reference mission which is currently OSTM/Jason-2."

## Ocean colour

Remote sensing reflectance, daily L3 bins (4.6 km MODISA, 9.2 km SeaWiFS). 

Oceandata MODIS Aqua Level-3 binned daily RRS

Daily remote-sensing reflectance from MODIS Aqua. RRS is used to produce (Johnson 2013) chlorophyll concentration. 


Oceandata SeaWiFS Level-3 binned daily RRS

Daily remote-sensing reflectance from SeaWiFS. RRS is used to produce (Johnson 2013) chlorophyll concentration.
